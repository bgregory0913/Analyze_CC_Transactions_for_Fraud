# Using PostreSQL to Analyze Credit Card Trasactions for Fraudulent Charges

## Utilizing fictitious card holders, their credit cards, and the transactions made with various merchants:

### Project Purpose:
_Demonstrate the use of standard deviations or quartiles to identify outliers in credit card transactions and determine if they are fraudulaent._

### Project Overview:
__1. First, define a database model based on the .csv file data in the CSV_Data folder and create a database diagram normalizing the data in the best possible structure:__
  1. Create a PostgreSQL database from the model.
1. Add any necessary schema's and import the .csv data into the tables.
1. Analyze the data looking for possible fraudulent transactional trends.
   1. Additionally, visualizations can be generated to display the findings.


### Built With:

This project is written in Python using Jupyter Notebook and the SQLAlchemy and NumPy modules.
